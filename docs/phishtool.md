## Email Phishing
Phishing emails are often the first step in a cyber attack. 
Hackers trick people into opening harmful files or links in emails that look real. 
Once opened, the hackers can put malware on the victim's computer, steal passwords and personal information, 
and even commit fraud or launch ransomware attacks.

As it is a common attack, analyzing the phishing emails are common work for the Security Operation Center Analyst role.
